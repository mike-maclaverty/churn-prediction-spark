## 1. Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project is a tutorial on how to train a `churn prediction model` using entirely `Spark`. It contains a prototyping step within the notebook file.
Also, it shows how you can ship your research code into a Spark processing file that can be shipped into production.

It uses a `music streaming dataset` based on a fictional company called Sparkify which contains all kinds of events created by the users who interacted with
the platform.

The training is done entirely with Spark, starting from the cleaning until the training and evaluation steps.

## 2. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
### Install Dependencies
The dependencies are versioned by `poetry`. Make sure to have it installed on your system.
Also, the code was tested with:
* Ubuntu 20.04
* Python 3.8

<br/>From the root directory run:
```shell
poetry install
```

## 3. Data <a name="data"></a>
To train the models, we used a dataset provided by Udacity with user activity from a fictional streaming
music company called Sparky. It consists of user events within the platform such as: `Login`, `NextSong`, `Error`, etc.

We considered `churn` users the ones that left the platform by generating an event with the `page=Cancellation Confirmation`.

<br/> You can download the mini Sparkify dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14jI_mEW4pVFEESWYM0k8FkKIUHPUUzwh?usp=sharing).

<br/> The file should be placed under the root directory.

## 4. Usage <a name="usage"></a>
### Files Structure
The prototyping was done within the `Sparkify.ipynb` Notebook.
The same code was shipped in the `process.py` Python file, which can be run and automated with `Spark.

Both files contain the following steps:
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model training & testing

The EDA component is only within the `Sparkify.ipynb` Notebook.
You can look at the `EDA` within an exported PDF at `Sparkify.pdf`.

Using `publish.py` we automatically pushed the Notebook to Medium 
(you can see how to set up `jupyter_to_medium` [here](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-to-medium/)).

### Run
#### Run Notebook
Run the notebook with:
```shell
jupyter notebook .
```

#### Run Spark Script
Run the Spark Python script with:
```shell
export PYSPARK_PYTHON=`which python`
spark-submit --master localhost process.py
```

## 5. Results <a name="results"></a>
The results show the `F1 score` on the validation and test.
The validation split was computed within a `cross-validation` with a `3 folds` step.
The test split represents `20%` of the initial data.

|        Model        | Validation |    Test    |
|:-------------------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Logistic Regression |   0.6958   |   0.5952   |
|     Naive Bayes     |   0.6672   |   0.5952   |
|  Gradient Boosting  | **0.7333** | **0.8473** |

The GBT model performed better than the Logistic Regression and the Naive Bayes. 
Probably, because it is a more complex model that can understand non-linear relationships better.

**Note:** You can read a detailed examination of the results on [Medium](https://pub.towardsai.net/this-is-how-you-can-build-a-churn-prediction-model-using-spark-e187b7eca339).

I want to thank Udacity for its contribution to making the data available. Without their assistance, I would not have been able to train the models.
